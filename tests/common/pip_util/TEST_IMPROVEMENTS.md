## Detailed Improvements

### 1. test_dependency_version_protection_with_pin

**File**: `test_dependency_protection.py:34-94`

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ Added exact version assertions based on DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md
- ✅ Verified initial versions: urllib3==1.26.15, certifi==2023.7.22, charset-normalizer==3.2.0
- ✅ Added verification that idna is NOT pre-installed
- ✅ Added assertion that idna==3.10 is installed as NEW dependency
- ✅ Verified requests==2.32.5 is installed
- ✅ Added detailed error messages explaining what versions are expected and why

**Key Assertions Added**:
```python
# Verify expected OLD versions
assert initial_urllib3 == "1.26.15", f"Expected urllib3==1.26.15, got {initial_urllib3}"
assert initial_certifi == "2023.7.22", f"Expected certifi==2023.7.22, got {initial_certifi}"
assert initial_charset == "3.2.0", f"Expected charset-normalizer==3.2.0, got {initial_charset}"

# Verify idna is NOT installed initially
assert "idna" not in initial, "idna should not be pre-installed"

# Verify new dependency was added (idna is NOT pinned, so it gets installed)
assert "idna" in final_packages, "idna should be installed as new dependency"
assert final_packages["idna"] == "3.10", f"Expected idna==3.10, got {final_packages['idna']}"
```

**Based on Context**:
- DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md Section 1: requests → Dependencies
- Verified: Without pin, urllib3 would upgrade to 2.5.0 (MAJOR version jump)
- Verified: idna is NEW dependency (not in requirements-test-base.txt)

---

### 2. test_dependency_chain_with_six_pin

**File**: `test_dependency_protection.py:117-162`

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ Added exact version assertion for six==1.16.0
- ✅ Added exact version assertion for python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0
- ✅ Added detailed error messages
- ✅ Added docstring reference to DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md

**Key Assertions Added**:
```python
# Verify expected OLD version
assert initial_six == "1.16.0", f"Expected six==1.16.0, got {initial_six}"

# Verify final versions
assert final_packages["python-dateutil"] == "2.9.0.post0", f"Expected python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0"
assert final_packages["six"] == "1.16.0", "six should remain at 1.16.0 (prevented 1.17.0 upgrade)"
```

**Based on Context**:
- DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md Section 2: python-dateutil → Dependencies
- Verified: six is a REAL dependency (not optional like colorama)
- Verified: Without pin, six would upgrade from 1.16.0 to 1.17.0

---

### 3. test_pin_only_affects_specified_packages ✨ NEW

**File**: `test_dependency_protection.py:165-208`

**Purpose**: Verify that pin is selective, not global

**Test Logic**:
1. Verify idna is NOT pre-installed
2. Verify requests is NOT pre-installed
3. Install requests with pin policy (only pins urllib3, certifi, charset-normalizer)
4. Verify idna was installed at latest version (3.10) - NOT pinned
5. Verify requests was installed at expected version (2.32.5)

**Key Assertions**:
```python
# Verify idna was installed (NOT pinned, so gets latest)
assert "idna" in final_packages, "idna should be installed as new dependency"
assert final_packages["idna"] == "3.10", "idna should be at latest version 3.10 (not pinned)"
```

**Based on Context**:
- DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md: "⚠️ idna is NEW and NOT pinned (acceptable - new dependency)"
- Verified: Pin only affects specified packages in pinned_packages list

---

### 4. test_major_version_jump_prevention ✨ NEW

**File**: `test_dependency_protection.py:211-271`

**Purpose**: Verify that pin prevents MAJOR version jumps with breaking changes

**Test Logic**:
1. Verify initial urllib3==1.26.15
2. **Test WITHOUT pin**: Uninstall deps, install requests → urllib3 upgrades to 2.x
3. Verify urllib3 was upgraded to 2.x (starts with "2.")
4. Reset environment
5. **Test WITH pin**: Install requests with pin → urllib3 stays at 1.x
6. Verify urllib3 stayed at 1.26.15 (starts with "1.")

**Key Assertions**:
```python
# Without pin - verify urllib3 upgrades to 2.x
assert without_pin["urllib3"].startswith("2."), \
    f"Without pin, urllib3 should upgrade to 2.x, got {without_pin['urllib3']}"

# With pin - verify urllib3 stays at 1.x
assert final_packages["urllib3"] == "1.26.15", \
    "Pin should prevent urllib3 from upgrading to 2.x (breaking changes)"
assert final_packages["urllib3"].startswith("1."), \
    f"urllib3 should remain at 1.x series, got {final_packages['urllib3']}"
```

**Based on Context**:
- DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md: "urllib3 1.26.15 → 2.5.0 is a MAJOR version jump"
- DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md: "urllib3 2.0 removed deprecated APIs"
- This is the MOST IMPORTANT test - prevents breaking changes

---

### 5. test_package_deletion_and_restore

**File**: `test_environment_recovery.py:33-78`

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ Added exact version assertion for six==1.16.0
- ✅ Added verification that six is restored to EXACT version (not latest)
- ✅ Added detailed error messages
- ✅ Added docstring reference to DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md

**Key Assertions Added**:
```python
# Verify six is initially installed at expected version
assert initial["six"] == "1.16.0", f"Expected six==1.16.0, got {initial['six']}"

# Verify six was restored to EXACT required version (not latest)
assert final_packages["six"] == "1.16.0", \
    "six should be restored to exact version 1.16.0 (not 1.17.0 latest)"
```

**Based on Context**:
- DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md: "six: 1.16.0 (OLD) → 1.17.0 (LATEST)"
- Verified: Restore policy restores to EXACT version, not latest

---

### 6. test_version_change_and_restore

**File**: `test_environment_recovery.py:105-158`

**Enhancements**:
- ✅ Added exact version assertions (1.26.15 initially, 2.1.0 after upgrade)
- ✅ Added verification of major version change (1.x → 2.x)
- ✅ Added verification of major version downgrade (2.x → 1.x)
- ✅ Added detailed error messages explaining downgrade capability
- ✅ Added docstring reference to DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md

**Key Assertions Added**:
```python
# Verify version was changed to 2.x
assert installed_after["urllib3"] == "2.1.0", \
    f"urllib3 should be upgraded to 2.1.0, got {installed_after['urllib3']}"
assert installed_after["urllib3"].startswith("2."), \
    "urllib3 should be at 2.x series"

# Verify version was DOWNGRADED from 2.x back to 1.x
assert final["urllib3"] == "1.26.15", \
    "urllib3 should be downgraded to 1.26.15 (from 2.1.0)"
assert final["urllib3"].startswith("1."), \
    f"urllib3 should be back at 1.x series, got {final['urllib3']}"
```

**Based on Context**:
- DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md: "urllib3 can upgrade from 1.26.15 (1.x) to 2.5.0 (2.x)"
- Verified: Restore policy can DOWNGRADE (not just prevent upgrades)
- Tests actual version downgrade capability (2.x → 1.x)

|----------|----------|
| Pin prevents upgrades | ✅ Basic |
| New dependencies installed | ❌ Not tested |
| Pin is selective | ❌ Not tested |
| Major version jump prevention | ❌ Not tested |
| Exact version restoration | ❌ Not tested |

### After Improvements

| Scenario | Coverage | Test |
|----------|----------|------|
| Pin prevents upgrades | ✅ Enhanced | test_dependency_version_protection_with_pin |
| New dependencies installed | ✅ Added | test_dependency_version_protection_with_pin |
| Pin is selective | ✅ Added | test_pin_only_affects_specified_packages |

## Key Testing Principles Applied

### 1. Exact Version Verification

**Before**:
```python
assert final_packages["urllib3"] == initial_urllib3  # Generic
```

**After**:
```python
assert initial_urllib3 == "1.26.15", f"Expected urllib3==1.26.15, got {initial_urllib3}"
assert final_packages["urllib3"] == "1.26.15", "urllib3 should remain at 1.26.15 (prevented 2.x upgrade)"
```

**Benefit**: Fails with clear message if environment setup is wrong

---

### 2. Version Series Verification

**Added**:
```python
assert final_packages["urllib3"].startswith("1."), \
    f"urllib3 should remain at 1.x series, got {final_packages['urllib3']}"
```

**Benefit**: Catches major version jumps even if exact version changes

---

### 3. Negative Testing (Verify NOT Installed)

**Added**:
```python
assert "idna" not in initial, "idna should not be pre-installed"
```

**Benefit**: Ensures test environment is in expected state

---

### 4. Context-Based Documentation

**Every test now includes**:
```python
"""
Based on DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md:
    <specific section reference>
    <expected behavior from context>
"""
```

**Benefit**: Links test expectations to verified dependency data

---

## Real-World Scenarios Tested

### Scenario 1: Preventing Breaking Changes

**Test**: `test_major_version_jump_prevention`

**Real-World Impact**:
- urllib3 2.0 removed deprecated APIs
- Many applications break when upgrading from 1.x to 2.x
- Pin prevents this automatic breaking change

**Verified**: ✅ Pin successfully prevents 1.x → 2.x upgrade

---

### Scenario 2: Allowing New Dependencies

**Test**: `test_pin_only_affects_specified_packages`

**Real-World Impact**:
- New dependencies are safe to add (idna)
- Pin should not block ALL changes
- Only specified packages are protected

**Verified**: ✅ idna installs at 3.10 even with pin policy active

---

### Scenario 3: Version Downgrade Recovery

**Test**: `test_version_change_and_restore`

**Real-World Impact**:
- Sometimes packages get upgraded accidentally
- Need to downgrade to known-good version
- Downgrade is harder than upgrade prevention

**Verified**: ✅ Can downgrade urllib3 from 2.x to 1.x

---

## Test Execution Performance

```
Test Performance Summary:

test_dependency_version_protection_with_pin       2.28s  (enhanced)
test_dependency_chain_with_six_pin               2.00s  (enhanced)
test_pin_only_affects_specified_packages         2.25s  (NEW)
test_major_version_jump_prevention               3.53s  (NEW - does 2 install cycles)
test_package_deletion_and_restore                2.25s  (enhanced)
test_version_change_and_restore                  2.24s  (enhanced)

Total: 14.10s for 6 tests
Average: 2.35s per test
```

**Note**: `test_major_version_jump_prevention` is slower because it tests both WITH and WITHOUT pin (2 install cycles).

## Future Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

Update tests when:
- ✅ PyPI releases new major versions (e.g., urllib3 3.0)
- ✅ Base package versions change in requirements-test-base.txt
- ✅ New test scenarios added to DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md
- ✅ Policy behavior changes in pip_util.py

### How to Update Tests

1. Run `python analyze_dependencies.py --all`
2. Update expected version numbers in tests
3. Update DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md
4. Update TEST_SCENARIOS.md
5. Run tests to verify

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify environment
python analyze_dependencies.py --env

# Verify package dependencies
python analyze_dependencies.py requests
python analyze_dependencies.py python-dateutil

# Run all tests
pytest test_dependency_protection.py test_environment_recovery.py -v --override-ini="addopts="
```

---

## Summary

✅ **6 tests** now verify real PyPI package dependencies
✅ **100% pass rate** with real pip operations
✅ **All version numbers** verified against DEPENDENCY_TREE_CONTEXT.md
✅ **Major version jump prevention** explicitly tested
✅ **Selective pinning** verified (only specified packages)
✅ **Version downgrade** capability tested

**Key Achievement**: Tests now verify actual PyPI behavior, not mocked expectations.
